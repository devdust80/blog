# Blog

Welcome to my blog! This is a static site built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Creating a New Post

To create a new blog post, use the Hugo CLI:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-post-title.md
```

This command generates a new markdown file in the `posts` directory with the necessary front matter.

## Getting Started

- Edit posts in the `content/posts/` directory
- Run `hugo server` to preview changes locally
- Deploy the `public/` folder to your hosting service

Happy writing!
