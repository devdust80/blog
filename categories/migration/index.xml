We need a solution that preserves our existing feature set whilst managing the inevitable changes to configuration and architectural concepts. Several options exist in this space, but as part of this practice I wanted to share my experience with migrating from ingress-nginx to HAProxy Ingress Controller, and the challenges I faced during this process. One of the main challenges was related to mTLS and client certificate authentication, specifically in the scenario where we wanted to allow for mTLS without enforcing strict SSL verification, and also passing the client certificate to the backend services which is a common use case in many applications but is not natively supported in official HAProxy Ingress Controller&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
